Schubert-Tausig-Horowitz Military March
=======================================
This is not the original Schubert version of Military March, but Horowitz performance version based on Carl Tausig&apos;s improvisation.

Lilypond version
----------------
Starting from mid-2010, and basic typesetting is done after 1.5 years. Not beautified. Requires 2.12 version, so it can take some time to make the score 2.18 compatible.
