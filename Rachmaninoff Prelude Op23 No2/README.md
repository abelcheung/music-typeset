Rachmaninoff Prelude Op. 23 No. 2
=================================

Mup version
-----------
Basic Mup typesetting was done in 2004. However it is not beautified yet.

Lilypond version
----------------
It can be found currently in [my fork of Github Mutopia repository](https://github.com/abelcheung/The-Mutopia-Project/tree/rachmaninoff-prelude23-02/ftp/RachmaninoffS), and *might* be submitted officially to Mutopia in future (if its maintainer cares at all).
