Prokofiev Piano Concerto No. 2
==============================
Mup version was a failure. Planned to start doing LilyPond version, but not started yet.

Mup version
-----------

This represents a failed attempt to typeset Prokofiev Piano Concerto No. 2,
starting from around 2001 and continuing intermittently for 8 years, and
finally abandoned because Mup has never added support for cross-bar beaming
(to be precise, that feature sits in todo list forever). It is impractical
to manually draw all such beams with postscript, and obviously everything
will be broken again when automatic layout changes.

More detailed explanation available [on my blog](http://me.abelcheung.org/2010/03/19/9-years-of-worthless-waiting-for-usable-music-typesetting-program/). Anyway, these files are only uploaded for historical interest.
