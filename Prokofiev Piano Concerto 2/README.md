Prokofiev Piano Concerto No. 2
==============================
Mup version was a failure. Lilypond version has only been starting recently
(Jul 2014). Expecting data entry would not finish within a few months.

Mup version
-----------
This represents a failed attempt to typeset Prokofiev Piano Concerto No. 2,
starting from around 2001 and continuing intermittently for 8 years, and
finally abandoned because Mup has never added support for cross-bar beaming
(to be precise, that feature sits in todo list forever). It is impractical
to manually draw all such beams with postscript, and obviously everything
will be broken again when automatic layout changes.

Basic data entry was done for first 3 movements. Less than 100 bars was
entered for 4<sup>th</sup> movement.

More detailed explanation available [on my blog](http://me.abelcheung.org/2010/03/19/9-years-of-worthless-waiting-for-usable-music-typesetting-program/). Anyway, these files are only uploaded for historical interest.
